# Interlay Demo

Codes in this repo represents the demo implmented for Interlay Network team.

Currently, the following features are implemented from scratch using Polkadot-JS modules:

- Connect a Para Chain (Interlay for now)
- Connect to a Wallet (Talisman has been tested)
- Choose Your Account
- Validate the Account Compatibility with the Para Chain
- View the Free/Reserved/Frozen Balances (for all the available assets)
- Create a Transaction (Send tokens)
- See the Transaction Status Step-by-Step

## Install and Run

To start the project in your localhost and exploring the tools, follow the steps below:

- Clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/ahsefati/interlayDemo.git```

- Install dependencies

```yarn insatll```

```yarn dev```

## Notes
- To work with the app, you should have at least one wallet. I recommend using Talisman for testing purposes.
